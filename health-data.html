Washington MHMDA & CTDPA Supplement
*Last Updated: February 25, 2026*

---

## 1. Scope and Definitions

This Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy ("Health Notice") is a supplement to our general Privacy Policy and specifically addresses "Consumer Health Data" (CHD) as defined under the **Washington My Health My Data Act** (RCW 19.373.010) and the **Connecticut Data Privacy Act** (CTDPA).

**CHD** means personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies the consumer's past, present, or future physical or mental health status.

For Connecticut residents, the consent mechanisms described herein also satisfy CTDPA §6-1(a)(4) requirements for processing sensitive data.

---

## 2. Categories and Sources of CHD Collected

### 2.1 Categories of CHD

- **Mental or Emotional Health Inferences** — AI-generated assessments of mood or emotional well-being derived from LLM analysis during interactions.
- **Voluntary Health Disclosures** — Information concerning symptoms, medications, or treatment plans you choose to disclose in chat logs.
- **Interaction Patterns** — Metadata regarding frequency and duration of use used solely to infer psychological status.

### 2.2 Sources of CHD

We collect CHD from:

- You directly, via text and voice inputs
- Your device and app usage patterns (telemetry)
- Inferences we generate internally

---

## 3. Purposes of Collection and Use

We collect CHD solely to provide the AI companionship experience and maintain service security.

- **Crisis Resources** — Our system may use automated, best-effort detection to provide crisis resources (e.g., 988). Consistent with our Terms of Service, this automated feature does not constitute human monitoring or a duty to intervene.
- **Restrictions** — We do not use CHD for targeted advertising, credit assessment, or discriminatory pricing. We will not collect new categories of CHD without obtaining fresh affirmative consent.

---

## 4. Sharing and Third-Party Recipients

**4.1 Categories Shared** — We disclose the CHD categories listed in Section 2 to the recipients below.

**4.2 Third-Party Entities:**

- **Google Gemini API (Google LLC)** — Conversational AI processing
- **Google Cloud (Google LLC)** — Secure, encrypted storage and hosting

> We maintain Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with these providers that strictly prohibit their use of your CHD for their own independent purposes or model training.

**4.3 No Sale or Cross-Context Sharing** — We do not sell CHD or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising. Any future sale would require a separate, written "valid authorization."

---

## 5. Your Rights and Non-Discrimination

You have the right to **access**, **delete**, and **withdraw consent** for your CHD without discrimination.

- **Access** — Our response will include a list of all third parties and affiliates with whom CHD was shared, including an online contact mechanism for those parties.
- **Delete** — We will notify all processors and contractors to delete your CHD. Deletion from backups will occur within 90 days.
- **Non-Discrimination** — We will not deny service or change prices based on your exercise of these rights.

---

## 6. Exercising Rights and Appeals

Submit requests to **contact@soullogicai.com**. We will verify your identity using your account credentials.

- **Timeline** — We respond within **45 days** (extendable by 45 days with notice).
- **Appeals** — If denied, you may appeal by emailing us. If the appeal is denied, you may contact the Washington Attorney General or the Connecticut Attorney General.

---

## 7. Separate and Distinct Consent

**7.1 Affirmative Consent** — Before collecting CHD, we will present a standalone in-app prompt describing the specific categories and purposes. This request is not bundled with other terms.

**7.2 Withdrawal** — You may withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal will stop future collection but may render core features of the Services unavailable.
